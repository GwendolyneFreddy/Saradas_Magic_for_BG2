@1 = ~You can't be serious, Edwin. Elminster is the most powerful wizard in the Realms... Don't waste your life like that.~
@2 = ~Shut up, old man! I didn't ask for your opinion.~
@3 = ~I have to admit that it would be quite funny to see you lose your dignity against Elminster...~
@4 = ~Who knows, maybe you will give me that satisfaction, one day.~
